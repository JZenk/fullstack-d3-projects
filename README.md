# fullstack-d3-projects

Working through [Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3) book by [Amelia Wattenberger](https://wattenberger.com/).

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Yarn (for Prettier)

## Getting Started

You'll need a static file server to circumvent CORS limitations. Here are two options that will work -- feel free to use either, or another one that you're comfortable with.

Once **node.js** and **npm** are installed, run the following command in your terminal.

```shell
npm install -g live-server
```

This will install [**live-server**](https://github.com/tapio/live-server), a simple static server that has live reload built-in. To start your server, run `live-server` in the root `/fullstack-d3-projects` folder and it will even open a new browser window for you.
